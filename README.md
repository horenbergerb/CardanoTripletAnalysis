# CardanoTripletAnalysis

Contains multiple files for experimenting with Cardano triplets.

PRIME.PY IS DEPRICATED and replaced by SymPy package
Primes.py contains code for generating, saving, and loading primes in primes.txt. It also contains code for factoring numbers
Primes.txt contains primes in a JSON format.

CardanoTools.py contains a bunch of hacky code for counting cardano triplets. Currently not rigged to save results, although this could be handy. Saving is halfway implemented.

CardanoTest.py actually runs the tools from CardanoTools.


TO DO:

Make the multiprocessing split up n values more fairly.

Compare with Zach's code. Any efficiencies I've missed?

Add useful debug stuff. I got lazy halfway through writing it.

Make Cardano tools more modular.

Add visualizations. Could be of solutions or of Cardano eq in general. Get creative. Probably use a separate file for visualizations.
